# KNR_Movie_Reviews
A Blog where me and my friends can leave our reviews for movies.


Website is actively under developement, a lot of the code is currently placeholder to for the structue or add temporary styling during developement. 


Final Style Goals - have the header that resembles a curtain and the reast of the site look like a theater from a birds eye view.


MVP - 1) add new reviews
      2) edit old reviews
      3) search existing reviews
      4) store data on a server to prevent lost between site visits

Will need to look into what data stucture best suits out data curently thinking a hash table.

Note: Try to keep html file slim by managing the majority of it using java script. can test styling using static html for ease.
